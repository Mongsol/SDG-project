                Gender equality means that the rights,
                responsibilities and opportunities of
                individuals will not depend on whether 
                they are male or female, handicapped or able bodied,
                young or elderly, white or black, or 
                from rural or urban settings.

                        Examples of gender equality
                        <li>
                            Equality at Home: Gender equality in this example would look like splitting up at-home work as evenly as possible between all genders of a household, so that the burden of taking care of the home and family is not solely on women.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Equal Pay for Equal Work: The pay gap between men and women remains strong throughout the United States and around the world, especially for women who are mothers or caretakers. Gender equality in the workforce means being paid the same salary for equal work, regardless of gender. It also means that if a woman takes time off from work to take maternity leave, for example, she will not be punished when she returns to work. She will still be considered for the same promotions, pay raises and career opportunities that she would have been given had she not taken the necessary time off to care for her family.
